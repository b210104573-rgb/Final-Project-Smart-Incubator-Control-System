# Smart Egg Incubator Monitoring and Control System

Final project **Mechatronics Engineering Design**

---

## 📌 Project Summary
This project presents a smart egg incubator system designed to automatically monitor and control the environmental conditions required for egg incubation. The system focuses on maintaining stable **temperature** and **humidity**, performing **automatic egg turning**, and notifying the user in case of abnormal conditions using **SMS alerts**.

The goal of the project is to increase incubation reliability, reduce manual intervention, and improve hatch success rates compared to traditional incubator systems.
